# AutoAdjustableTextTable
AutoAdjustableTextTable is a Objective-C framework that focus on solving problems of a list of input text fields.

Collecting information from users are very common in iOS applications. For example, many applications allow users to create their profile through inputting a series of private inforamtion, such as names, ages, emails, phone numbers, bios, etc. 
When users need to type in the information manually or select from a set of opitons, coding table cell for each text field is redundant work. Additionaly, it's hard to estimate how much space should be left for a specific text field. AutoAdjustableTextTable resolves these problems by auto-calculating and resizing each text cell, and adjust other cells in the list accordingly.

Combine with the scrolling of UIScrollView, AutoAdjustableTextTable could also achieve highlighting the current inputted text cell by scrolling it right above keyboard or option picker.
